### Introduction

Hi there, I'm **venashial**. I love [programming](https://github.com/venashial/), designing UIs, making [games](https://venashial.games), and creating vector art. I also love to read [sci-fi](https://web.archive.org/web/20210901215052if_/http://www.hatrack.com/osc/books/endersgame/) & [fantasy](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) books, watch [animated shows](https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/she-ra-and-the-princesses-of-power) & [sitcoms](https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/the-good-place), and listen to [musicals](https://www.hadestown.com/#home).

### Programming

Programming is a core part of who I am and who I will be. It's hard to put into words the joy of seeing a function work after hours of trial and error. For better or for worse, the problem solving nature of coding is weaved into my mind, whether I'm sitting at my desk or going on a hike.

So what do I program? I create websites and servers with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). I contribute to open source projects, like [modrinth/knossos](https://github.com/modrinth/knossos) for fun and to better the app for everyone. In addition, I have a plethora of [my own projects](https://github.com/venashial?tab=repositories), most solve problems I've encountered or test a new technology I've learned.

How do you write code? My setup normally consists of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), plus some other browsers for ample testing. For websites, I use a front-end javascript framework such as [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) ([Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev)) & [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) ([Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/)). For servers, I use [Deno](https://deno.land/) & [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and containerize it with docker plus docker-compose. To deploy websites, I've used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but I also self host projects on occasion with [Portainer](Portainer).
